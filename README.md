# 👋 Hi, I’m @tixlegeek

I don't use github except to share some bits of code, because it's needy, not standard, and ugly. I use my own private git server, also, don't expect to see much here.

You can find more about my projects and me here: https://tixlegeek.io/splash/ or on twitter https://twitter.com/tixlegeek or on mastodon @tixlegeek@piaille.fr

I'm all about C/Js/Node/PHP/Bash, making robots, admin sys, ITSec, Embedded systems, Reverse engineering, electronics, and stuff like that.
